# My-Website-
Greetings!
Welcome to my first repository on GitHub.
This also happens to be the first ever website I have created. Thanks to the Udemy courses on HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
If you have seen the code, you will understand that I have used bootstrap heavily.
Components like navbars, modals, carousels which are a few of the functionalities offered by Bootstrap are very handy.

For the execution, you need to use Visual Code Studio and the link to bootstrap, poppers and Jscript (I used 4.1.3) needs to be added to your script.
A link to the Font-Awesome icons is also needed. Bootsrap, indeed minimizes the usage of CSS with its available scripts.
We just need to add them to our code and edit accordingly.

All the beautiful pictures, that I have used are from Unsplash. Please check their amazing content out!
Thank you for your time!

Regards
Poojitha
